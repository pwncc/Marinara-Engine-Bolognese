# Noodle Settings and Chat Carryover

This guide covers the **Noodle settings** panel section by section, with every default and limit. It also explains how to connect Noodle to your chats. Two features do this: **Carryover to chats** and the per-chat **Allow Noodle references** toggle. They work in opposite directions.

Noodle is the in-app social media timeline in Marinara Engine. If you are new to it, read [Noodle: The In-App Social Timeline](overview.md) first. A persona is the character you play as in a chat. A connection is a saved link to an AI provider that generates text or images. See [Connecting to an AI Provider](../connections/connecting-to-a-provider.md).

## Opening the Noodle settings panel

1. Open Noodle from the top bar.
2. In the left sidebar, click the **Settings** button (the gear icon).
3. The panel header reads **Noodle settings**.

All Noodle settings are global. They apply to every persona and every chat, not to one chat at a time. Changes save as soon as you make them.

## Invites

The **Invites** section chooses which characters can take part in a Noodle refresh. A refresh is when the AI writes a batch of posts, replies, reposts, and likes for the invited accounts.

- **Characters to Invite**: a search box. Type here to filter both the folder list and the character list below it.
- **Add from Folder**: click to expand a list of your character folders. Check one or more folders, then click the invite button at the bottom. The button label changes with your selection:
  - **Select folders to invite** when nothing is checked.
  - **Selected folder characters are invited** when everything is already invited.
  - **Invite N characters** when there are new characters to add.
- **Characters**: a scrollable list of every character in your library. Each row has an invite or remove button. Its status shows as **Invited**, **Included by folder**, or **Not invited**.

Inviting from a folder is a one-time bulk action. It is not a live sync. Characters you add to that folder later are not invited automatically.

## Refresh

The **Refresh** section controls the AI connection Noodle writes with.

- **Generation connection**: a dropdown. Pick the text connection Noodle uses to write posts, replies, reposts, likes, and profile text. It starts unset with the placeholder **Choose connection**. You must pick one before **Refresh timeline** will run.
- **Refreshes/day**: a number, from 0 to 24, default **2**. This setting is meant for automated refresh scheduling, which does not exist yet. It has no effect today. It does not limit how often you can refresh by hand.

Today you refresh by hand with the **Refresh timeline** button in the timeline. See [Noodle: The In-App Social Timeline](overview.md) for how to run one.

## Active Accounts

The **Active Accounts** section sets how many eligible accounts take part in one refresh. Eligible accounts are your invited characters, folder-included characters, and random users if you turned them on.

- **Active selection**: a dropdown, default **Random range**. The options are **Random range**, **Exact count**, and **All invited**.
- With **Random range**, two fields appear: **Min active** (1 to 100, default **2**) and **Max active** (1 to 100, default **5**). Each refresh picks a count between them.
- With **Exact count**, one field appears: **Active count** (1 to 100). It sets a fixed number of accounts.
- With **All invited**, every eligible account takes part, with no cap.

Your active persona and Professor Mari are always eligible on top of these accounts.

## Activity

The **Activity** section limits how much a single refresh may create. Each field is a per-refresh cap.

| Field | Default | Range |
|---|---|---|
| **Posts** | 8 | 0 to 100 |
| **Replies** | 12 | 0 to 200 |
| **Reposts** | 4 | 0 to 100 |
| **Likes** | 18 | 0 to 500 |

Set a field to 0 to stop the AI from creating that kind of activity.

## Image Generation

The **Image Generation** section lets Noodle attach AI-made images to some posts. This needs an image-generation connection, which is a connection set up for making pictures. See [Supported AI Providers](../connections/providers-reference.md).

- **Image generation**: a toggle, default **off**. Turn it on to let the AI generate post images.
- When it is on, more controls appear:
  - **Image generation connection**: a dropdown, default **Default image generation connection**. Leaving it on Default uses whichever connection is marked default for image generation in the Connections panel.
  - **Prompt instructions**: a text box with built-in default text, up to 4000 characters. These extra notes are merged into the image prompt.
  - **Use avatar references**: a toggle, default **on**. Sends the character's avatar or reference images to the image model.
  - **Include descriptions**: a toggle, default **on**. Adds the character's written appearance notes to the image prompt.
  - **Images/day**: a number, 0 to 50, default **3**. This caps generated post images across the whole day, not per refresh.
- **Attach gallery images**: a separate toggle, default **off**. It stays visible even when **Image generation** is off. Instead of making a new image, it lets a post reuse an image from that character's gallery or from a chat they appear in.

If you turn on **Image generation** but have no usable image connection, a refresh is blocked. You will see the message "Choose an image generation connection for Noodle first." A single failed image does not fail the whole refresh. The post is still created without an image.

## Carryover

The **Carryover** section pushes recent Noodle activity into your chats. When on, a chat's prompt gets a "Recent Social Media Activity" block describing what your characters have been doing on Noodle.

- **Carryover to chats**: three separate toggles, all **off** by default: **Conversations**, **Roleplays**, and **Games**. Turn on the modes you want to receive Noodle activity.
- **Carry hours**: a number, 1 to 720, default **48**. This is how far back, in hours, Noodle looks for activity to carry over.
- **Carry items**: a number, 1 to 50, default **8**. This is the most activity summaries added to one chat turn.

Carryover only pulls activity for characters who are invited on Noodle, plus the chat's active persona. Folder-only inclusion is not enough here.

## Reset Noodle

The **Reset Noodle** section clears the timeline while keeping your accounts and settings.

1. Click the **Reset Noodle Timeline** button.
2. A dialog titled **Reset Noodle Timeline** appears. It reads "This removes all posts, replies, likes, reposts, activity digests, and refresh records. Profiles, follows, invites, and settings stay."
3. Click **Reset timeline** to confirm.

This only deletes timeline content. Your accounts, handles, bios, follows, invites, and every Noodle setting stay in place.

## Random users

Random users are six built-in ambient accounts that are not from your library: Thread Countess, Packet Soup, Orbit Notice, Glass Bulletin, Moth Hour, and Brine Index. Each has a short flavor bio.

You turn them on with the **Random users** row at the top of the **Characters** list in the **Invites** section. It is **off** by default. Its subtitle reads **Enabled** when on, or **Ambient fake profiles** when off. When on, these accounts can post, like, repost, reply, and follow during a refresh. They can never be followed from a profile.

## Connecting Noodle to your chats

Noodle and your chats can share context in two directions. These are two separate features. Turning one on does not turn on the other.

**Carryover to chats** (set in Noodle settings) sends Noodle activity into a chat. It adds the "Recent Social Media Activity" block to that chat's prompt, as described in the Carryover section above.

**Allow Noodle references** is a per-chat toggle. It sends chat activity the other way, into Noodle. You find it in the chat's own settings, near the **Connected Chats** area. See [Chat Settings Overview](../chats/chat-settings.md). It is **off** by default for every chat. Its description reads "Timeline refreshes may include recent messages from this chat, with the chat name, mode, and participants stated in the prompt."

To make Noodle activity appear in a chat, turn on the matching **Carryover to chats** mode. To let a Noodle refresh read from a chat, turn on that chat's **Allow Noodle references**. You can use either one alone, or both together.
