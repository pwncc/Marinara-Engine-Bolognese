# Achievements

This guide explains the Achievements feature in Marinara Engine. Achievements are cosmetic badges that unlock as you use the app. This guide covers where to find them, the full list, the on/off setting, and how unlocking works.

## What achievements are

Achievements are small collectible badges. Marinara Engine unlocks them in the background as you do normal things, like creating chats, characters, or personas, or visiting community links.

Achievements are purely cosmetic. They do not unlock features and they do not change how the app behaves. They are just a fun way to track what you have done.

Your progress is saved locally, inside the profile you are using. A different profile or a fresh install starts with nothing unlocked. Because the records are stored with your other profile data, they travel with a full profile backup.

## Opening the Achievements panel

The **Achievements** button lives on the Home screen. The Home screen is what you see when no chat is open. The button sits just under the Professor Mari chat box, and it shows a trophy icon.

Under the label, the button shows a live count, like **12 of 23 unlocked**. While it is still loading, it reads **Checking the collection...** instead.

To open the panel, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Home screen.
2. Find the **Achievements** button under the Professor Mari chat box.
3. Click it.

You should see the **Achievements** window open. At the top it shows a summary line, such as **12 of 23 achievements unlocked in this profile.** Below that is a grid of achievement cards.

Each card shows a badge icon, a title, a category label, and a short description. If a card is locked, the title reads **?????** and the icon is a lock. You cannot read what it is until you unlock it. Once you earn a card, it shows an **unlocked** tag. Cards with a target also show a **Progress** row and a progress bar.

The button and the panel only appear when the **Achievements** setting is turned on. See the setting section below. There is no other menu or page that shows achievements.

## The 23 achievements

There are 23 achievements, split into four categories: **Milestone**, **Community**, **Creation**, and **Collection**.

Some achievements are single unlocks. The **Creation** and **Collection** ones are ranked, with three tiers marked **I**, **II**, and **III**. The tiers unlock at 5, then 25, then 100. So the badge title can read something like **Hoarder II** once you reach the second tier.

| Achievement | Category | How you unlock it |
|---|---|---|
| **Diligent Student** | Milestone | Finish or skip the first-time tutorial. |
| **Hello World** | Milestone | Send your first message to Professor Mari from the Home screen. |
| **One Of Us** | Community | Click the **Discord** link in the Home screen footer. |
| **Based Backer** | Community | Click the **Support** link (it opens Ko-fi) in the Home screen footer. |
| **Backseat Appreciator** | Community | Click the **Credits** button in the Home screen footer. |
| **Who Needs IRL Friends** | Creation | Create Conversation mode chats (5, 25, 100). |
| **They Feel Real To Me** | Creation | Create Roleplay chats (5, 25, 100). |
| **I Have No Other Hobbies** | Creation | Create Game mode chats (5, 25, 100). |
| **Hoarder** | Collection | Collect characters (5, 25, 100). |
| **The World's A Stage** | Collection | Collect lorebooks (5, 25, 100). |
| **I Am A Gamer** | Collection | Collect personas (5, 25, 100). |

A few notes on the list:

- A persona is the profile that represents you in a chat. A lorebook is a set of background notes the AI can pull in.
- The **Collection** achievements count everything of that type in your library. Imported and downloaded items count too, not just ones you build yourself. For **Hoarder**, the built-in Professor Mari character is the one exception: it never counts.
- For the community achievements, just visiting the link is enough. You do not need to sign up or finish anything on the other site.

## The Achievements setting

You can turn the whole feature on or off with one toggle. Open **Settings**, go to the **General** tab, and find the **App Behavior** section. The toggle is labeled **Achievements**, and it is on by default.

The help text reads: "Shows the Home achievements button and unlock notifications. Tracking stays silent in the current profile when this is off."

Here is what the toggle does:

- On: the Home screen **Achievements** button and window appear, and you get a pop-up notice when something unlocks.
- Off: the button is hidden and the pop-up notices stop. The app still records your unlocks quietly in the background.

Because tracking continues while the setting is off, your progress is not lost. If you turn the setting back on later, everything you earned in the meantime is already there.

## How unlocking works

Marinara checks the ranked achievements against your current live counts. This check runs when a tracked action happens, such as creating a chat or clicking a footer link. It also runs when you open the Achievements panel.

When an action triggers an unlock and the setting is on, a small pop-up notice appears. Its title is **Achievement unlocked**, and it names the badge, for example **Hoarder II** or **One Of Us**.

Opening the panel can also unlock badges you already earned some other way. These catch-up unlocks are silent. The card just shows as unlocked, and no pop-up appears.

Once an achievement unlocks, it stays unlocked for good. This is true even if you later delete chats, characters, lorebooks, or personas and your count drops back down. The badge will not re-lock.

One thing to expect: the **Progress** bar on an already-unlocked card still shows your current live count. So a card can read something like **2 / 5** even though the badge is already earned. That is normal.

There is no button anywhere in the app to reset or clear your achievements.
