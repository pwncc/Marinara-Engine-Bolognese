/**
 * Items the Game Master invents (#6814, Capability API 1.51).
 *
 *   - `items.rarityCaps` and `items.propose` are read and checked at import: a cap names a rarity the
 *     ruleset has, once, and only number stats, inside each stat's own range and in whole numbers
 *     for a stat that takes them. The install gate asks for 1.51 for either.
 *   - A proposal is read against the ruleset's own words (ids or labels, in any case): what the
 *     ruleset does not have is left out, a rarity it does not have becomes its lowest, a number stat
 *     is held to its range and then to its rarity's cap (the part `like` started it from as well),
 *     and every change is said.
 *   - The Game Master's book invents: a catalog item's name is that item, `propose: false` refuses,
 *     a name still held is that item, one this book made is found again, one nobody holds is an item
 *     of its own under a new id (an older telling may hold the first), and ids never collide. The player's book cannot invent. Saved invented items are read back only while the
 *     ruleset can still read them.
 *   - The inventory tag reads a proposal's parts, the answer says what was changed, and a game
 *     without a ruleset adds the name as it always did.
 *   - The Game Master is shown the proposal form and the ruleset's words only when it may invent, and
 *     never a stat it is not shown: not in the words, not in the caps, not in what was changed.
