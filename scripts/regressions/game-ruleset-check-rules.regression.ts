/**
 * Rules a check can move for one roll (issue #6651): a difficulty named by its ladder step, a pool
 * rule whose face a check may move, two abilities rolled together, and a botch read off half the
 * dice. Capability API 1.37.
 *
 * What is pinned here:
 *   - A ladder step at the table: `difficulty="Label"` supplies the number (successes on a pool, the
 *     difficulty on a sum) and, on a pool, its per-die target; a bare `dc=` uses the target of the ONE
 *     step needing that many successes; `threshold=` and `dc=` still win; a name no step answers to,
 *     or two steps share, is ignored. The record writes the numbers, never the name.
 *   - A tag that names only a difficulty is an ask: kept by the reader, rolled only where a ladder
 *     can read it, left as written in a game without one, and kept whole by a sparse rewrite.
 *   - `explode` and `double` with a `min`: the schema's refusals, the roller's clamp and its
 *     precedence (an entry, then the tag, then the file), a rule with no `from` firing only when
 *     asked, the record saying a face only when the check moved it, and an entry refused at import
 *     where no check may move the rule.
 *   - `pool.abilityPlusAbility`: an ability check adds a second ability, a skill keeps swapping, and
 *     a summed ruleset cannot declare it.
 *   - `botch.rule: "halfOrMore"`: counted over the dice first thrown, a critical failure only with no
 *     success, a complication alongside any other result, written and read back by the record.
 *   - The Game Master's reminder offers each of these only where the ruleset declares it.
 *   - The skill-check endpoint and the one-request branch arm read a named difficulty too.
 *   - Every new key needs Capability API 1.37 to install, inline or in a catalog file.
