// Package-declared Game Master verbs (#5798) — the RUNTIME half.
//
// The declaration half is pinned by `capability-gm-verbs.regression.ts`. This one drives the parts
// that can actually change a chat: the gated read of a package's verb table off disk, the narration
// scan, and the executor. Everything below runs against a REAL installed-package registry in a
// temporary DATA_DIR and a REAL chats store, because the three claims worth pinning are all claims
// about persisted state:
//
//   1. A state verb's write is ABSOLUTE and lands through `patchMetadata` — the key's whole value is
//      replaced, the write ordinal is stamped, `updatedAt` is not touched, and applying the same
//      verb twice moves nothing. That absoluteness, not the claim record, is the entire reason a
//      duplicate dispatch is harmless.
//   2. An event verb emits exactly one `gm_verb` frame carrying an explicit packageId and the
//      chatId:messageId:swipeIndex triple, and leaves nothing behind.
//   3. Every refusal tier — no table, no permission, oversized, tampered, malformed, not ready,
//      wrong owner — yields no verbs and never throws, because none of them may cost a player a turn.
//
// Plus the coherence pins that no single-function test can make: the prompt render and the
// narration parse agree on every verb (a verb advertised but unmatchable leaks a raw bracket tag
// into the player's prose), both client SSE switches handle the events the server emits, and the
// two turn shapes that are not a GM writing prose —
//
//   4. An IMPERSONATED turn is taught nothing. It is the player writing, no parser runs over it, so
//      a taught verb could only surface as a raw bracket tag in the player's own message.
//   5. A VERB-ONLY turn keeps its turn. Its narration strips to empty, and the hidden-anchor gate it
//      then meets counted only Conversation commands — both zero in game mode — so the turn errored
//      and its already-validated writes were discarded before the executor was ever reached.
//   6. A MIXED turn does both. The verb executes and the skill check resolves over one narration, in
//      that order — the verb pass deletes text, the check pass only rewrites a tag in place — and the
//      surviving check keeps the turn off the anchor path entirely.
