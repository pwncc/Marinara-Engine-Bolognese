// Ruleset combat, slice C3b: the fight on screen, driven through the REAL exported helpers, the
// REAL example rulesets and the REAL English catalog, so nothing here can agree with a mistake the
// components also make.
//
// What it pins:
//   - Every event a fight can report has a line, and the line reads the ruleset's own words: 5e
//     rolls a d20 against AC and Ember Roads rolls 2d6 against a Guard, out of the same code.
//   - The menu comes out grouped in one order, an option says what it spends in the ruleset's own
//     budget and pool names, and the forecast is the server's numbers rather than a sum done here.
//   - Target picking stays inside the option's own list and its own count, and a heal is offered
//     the allies the server said it may be pointed at.
//   - The one decision that says a fight is the ruleset's own, for every combination of the three
//     things it reads, and the battle bridge standing aside for exactly that fight.
//   - The recap a finished fight hands the Game Master, from a real summary.
//   - Every localization key the changed client code asks for exists.
//   - Every reason the resolver can refuse with has a sentence, both on screen and in the server's
//     own reply, so a new reason cannot reach a player as a raw code or a shrug.
