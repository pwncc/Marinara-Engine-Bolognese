/**
 * Spending a resource to change a check (#6405, the standing-rule half).
 *
 * Some systems let a player pay for a roll they are about to make: a point of will for an automatic
 * success. It cannot be two tags in one reply, because the dice are thrown before the `[sheet: ...]`
 * commands are applied, so the check tag carries `spend="pool:N"` and ONE resolution both rolls and
 * pays.
 *
 * What is pinned:
 *   - `resolution.spend` buys automatic successes, and they are added after the dice are counted.
 *   - It can buy extra dice instead, thrown with the pool and held to the pool's own ceiling.
 *   - `perCheck` caps how many purchases one check may make; asking for more is clamped, not refused.
 *   - All or nothing: a pool that cannot cover the spend buys nothing and is not deducted.
 *   - The cost really leaves the sheet, and the record says what was paid and what nobody rolled.
 *   - Two checks in one turn spend from what the first one left, not from where the turn started.
 *   - The model never touches the dice: what it writes in `rolls=` is still discarded.
 *   - A check with no `spend=` rolls exactly as it does today.
 *   - Every refusal at import.
