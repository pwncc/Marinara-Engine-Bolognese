/**
 * A directive is prose the operator typed instead of prose the story produced.
 *
 * It runs through the ordinary agent path rather than a route of its own, so it
 * inherits connection resolution, the local model slot, prompt selection and the state
 * merge. The only difference is which text the lanes read, and that is what this pins:
 * the precedence between the three sources of narration, and the bound on what a
 * caller can push through it.
