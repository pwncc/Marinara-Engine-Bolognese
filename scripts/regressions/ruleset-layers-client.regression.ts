//
// What it pins: the setup wizard's toggles come out in declaration order and name the checked layer
// that rules one of them out; turning one on or off keeps the selection in that order and a blocked
// toggle changes nothing; the record the create call sends holds only the checked layers and is one
// the server accepts; a saved or shared setup restores the layers the installed ruleset still has
// and drops the rest; the catalog picker leaves out the entries a layer hides, in its list and in
// its count, while Refresh from ruleset still sees a row whose entry is now hidden; and every
// localization key the changed client code asks for exists.
