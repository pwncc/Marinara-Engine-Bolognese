/**
 * GM skill checks are rolled by the engine, not by the model.
 *
 * The GM used to write the whole check itself — die, modifier, total, outcome —
 * and the engine only ever second-guessed the first plain d20 in a turn, on the
 * client, after the fact. Two holes followed: a turn with three checks resolved
 * one, and a check whose invented arithmetic failed the audit had its numbers
 * corrected on the dice card while the invention stayed in the saved text for
 * the next turn to read back as fact.
 *
 * Now the GM emits checks sparse, and generation post-processing rolls every
 * tag that still owes a roll — sparse or self-reported-and-wrong — before the
 * turn reaches the client or the database. This pins that: all N resolved, the
 * player's own die and advantage mode preserved, honest tags left byte-identical,
 * a second pass rolling nothing, the legacy client fallback still able to fire
 * for old messages, and the prompt still telling the GM not to invent numbers.
 *
 * It also pins the boundary of that authority. The engine rolls d20 checks and
 * nothing else, so a tag naming a system it does not implement is left standing
 * — including a malformed one, which looks identical to a sparse d20 request
 * once the reader refuses to vouch for its numbers.
 *
 * And it pins the three ways that authority can be honest and still get the
 * answer wrong:
 *
 *   - A tag declaring advantage AND disadvantage names no system at all. The
 *     roller cancels the pair and throws one die, so passing the tag as rollable
 *     turned a declared `dice="2d20"` into a saved `dice="1d20"`.
 *   - A roll that CANNOT happen — the chat's modifiers failing to load — used to
 *     leave the turn saved exactly as the model wrote it, invented rolls, total
 *     and result included. The error path is not a licence to save the invention.
 *   - The player's sheet is found by who the player is, not by which card sits
 *     first in an array that recruiting and removal reorder.
