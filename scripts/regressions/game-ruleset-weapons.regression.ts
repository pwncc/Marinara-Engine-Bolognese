/**
 * Weapons as items (#6855, Capability API 1.55).
 *
 *   - An item's `attack` is read and checked at import: the ids it names, the kind of every stat it
 *     reads, and only what this ruleset's fights can do. A ruleset with no combat block carries one
 *     and reads nothing. The install gate asks for 1.55, in the ruleset file and in a catalog file.
 *   - A worn weapon is an attack in a ruleset fight: to hit from the best of its abilities with its
 *     skill, the proficiency bonus, its bonus; damage with the best of its damage abilities; reach
 *     and range in cells (both: thrown); versatile dice with a hand free; strikes; each value read
 *     off the item's own stat where it says so. One put away offers nothing.
 *   - In a pool fight a weapon's own target is the per-die target its attack is thrown against, and
 *     its forecast counts it.
 *   - A creature's resistance or immunity may name item tags a blow gets through it with, and a
 *     weapon's tags are what its blows carry.
 *   - Item facts and the Game Master's line say the attack, and an item invented like a weapon fights
 *     with its own stats.
