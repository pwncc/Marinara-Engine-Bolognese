// Package-declared Game Master verbs (#5798) — the DECLARATION half.
//
// The two pinned constants in gm-verb-table.schema.ts are the only reason the guards mean
// anything, and both are copies of facts that live somewhere else. This regression re-derives
// each of them from its real source and fails when the copy falls behind:
//   - RESERVED_GM_TAG_NAMES vs every bracket tag the GM and party reminders can render AND every
//     tag the Engine's five narration parsers match back out of a turn, so a new built-in tag
//     cannot become shadowable by a package verb;
//   - ENGINE_OWNED_METADATA_KEY_PREFIXES vs every top-level ChatMetadata key, every engine-owned
//     *_METADATA_KEY constant, and every key that lives in the interface's index signature rather
//     than in its declaration — read out of chat-metadata writes in all four of their shapes, reads
//     in all three of theirs, and the Engine's own curated list of per-chat keys, which is the only
//     source that sees a key written and read entirely across function boundaries — so a new engine
//     namespace cannot become squattable.
// A pin re-derived from an extractor narrower than the vocabulary passes vacuously, so each
// extractor is asserted to have found something first — a size floor, plus one canary per source
// that no other source in the union can supply. A canary is only load-bearing while it stays
// unique, and uniqueness is a property of the whole union: adding a source can silently make an
// existing canary vacuous, so every canary here is re-audited against the other sources whenever
// one joins. Where a source has no such key, the extractor's own behavior is pinned instead, on a
// synthetic input. Two things no sweep here can read: a metadata write handed a variable, which is
// counted rather than ignored with the count pinned; and a metadata read that happens inside a
// helper, off a parameter, which is why a curated Engine list is one of the sources.
//
// The rest drives the schema itself — the effect/metadataKey split, the D1 key-ownership rules,
// the per-argument caps, and the per-verb degradation — plus the fact that PR1a is inert: nothing
// in the Engine imports this schema yet.

/** Comments are stripped before every sweep below: a bracket tag inside a doc comment
 *  (`[some_tag: …]`, `"[tagPrefix:"`) is prose about the parser, not vocabulary it handles.
 *
 *  The stripper is the TypeScript compiler's own parser, because nothing short of a parser can do
 *  this correctly. Whether a `/` opens a comment, opens a regex or divides is not a lexical property
 *  of the two characters — it depends on the grammar around them — so every hand scan gets it wrong
 *  in both directions, and the one this replaced got it wrong in both: `/[/*]/` opened a block
 *  comment and ate the source through to the next `*` + `/` anywhere in the file, `/[//]/` and a
 *  regex ending `\//` each ate the rest of their own line, and a `'` inside a character class
 *  desynced the walk into treating live code as string body and skipping real comments inside it.
 *  Twenty-nine files across the sweep corpus came out wrong one of those two ways. Source deleted
 *  before a sweep reads it — or prose left in front of one — is exactly the vacuous narrowing this
 *  file exists to catch: a sweep reading less than it claims to, and passing because what it should
 *  have found went missing before it looked. So the parse IS the strip: every token's leading and
 *  trailing comment ranges, spliced out. Across the 1,337 swept files it removes 22,423 ranges, every
 *  one a well-formed comment, none overlapping a string, template or regex literal.
 *
 *  `fileName` is how the parser is told which dialect to read, and neither dialect is safe as a
 *  blanket default — `createSourceFile` takes it off the extension. Read as TSX, the `<{ Params: … }>`
 *  type argument on `app.get` in `game.routes.ts` parses as JSX and hides 313 of that file's 665
 *  comments; read as TS, the JSX in `markdown.tsx` hides 23 of its 105. Both are files swept below.
 *  Callers holding a path pass it; the synthetic fixtures take the default.
 *
 *  String literals are kept verbatim, as before, because Pin 1 reads bracket tags out of them and the
 *  metadata sweep strips them itself. */
