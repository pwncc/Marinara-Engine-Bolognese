/**
 * Wound tracks: health that is a track, not a number.
 *
 * A `live.tracks` entry that declares `levels` stops being a bounded integer and becomes a column
 * of boxes a MARK sits on. The DEFINITION holds kinds; the LIVE STATE holds marks, and the two
 * words never swap here either.
 *
 * What is pinned:
 *   - Placement in severity order, with a lighter mark pushed down rather than the new one appended.
 *   - The penalty in force is the one on the LOWEST marked level, never the sum of the marked ones.
 *   - An `amount` of several marks is applied ONE AT A TIME, across the point where the track fills.
 *   - A full track upgrades its lowest-severity mark by one step.
 *   - Overflow at the top severity, persisted through storage and read back.
 *   - Healing clears the lightest marks first, and clears overflow before marks.
 *   - A mixed-kind track, because that is where every rule above is actually decided.
 *   - The penalty takes dice off a pool and never below `pool.min`, and is a flat modifier on a sum.
 *   - A plain track behaves exactly as it does today.
 *   - Every refusal, at import and at the command.
 *   - A packaged ruleset with wound tracks needs Capability API 1.30.
