/**
 * Ruleset combat, slice C4a: the fight on a grid, driven with hand-drawn boards and scripted dice.
 *
 * What is pinned here:
 *   - A fight WITHOUT a board behaves byte for byte as it did before any of this existed. The same
 *     scenarios are run twice, on the very same rulesets that now declare a cell size, and the whole
 *     event log is compared.
 *   - Nothing is hard-wired to one game system. Every rule below is proven on the 5e draft, which
 *     measures in feet and has long shots, cover and opportunity strikes, AND on Ember Roads, which
 *     measures in paces, has none of those three, and proves that none of them is required.
 *   - The board is the TACTICAL engine's own grid and terrain table. This slice adds the way a
 *     tabletop grid is played on top of it: eight neighbours, distance as the larger axis
 *     difference, real burst, cone and line shapes, and line of sight.
 *   - The menu is still the only place legality lives. Where a move may go, who an option may be
 *     pointed at and where a shape may be aimed are all one rule the resolution checks against.
 *   - Every refusal changes nothing and says exactly why: out of reach, no line of sight, a cell
 *     that cannot be reached, a cell a shape may not be aimed at.
 *   - The format's cross-checks: a cell size above zero, a declared opportunity budget, reach and
 *     range columns that exist and hold numbers, a long distance at least the ordinary one, and a
 *     refusal for any of the board's keys without a cell size to measure them in.
 *   - Capability API 1.28.
