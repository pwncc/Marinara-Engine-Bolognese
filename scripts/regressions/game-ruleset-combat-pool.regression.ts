/**
 * Ruleset combat: the `dice-pool` kind (#6736), a fight thrown in the ruleset's own pools.
 *
 * What is pinned here, on Gravewatch, the Engine's own pool example, with scripted dice:
 *   - The principle: every number a roll ADDS is dice, and every number it MEETS is successes. A
 *     to-hit number is the pool (an Arm's rating and trade, with the trade's own rating and the row's
 *     ability swapped in), a defense is the successes a blow needs and never fewer than one, and each
 *     success past those adds a damage die.
 *   - The ruleset's own faces: a ten explodes, a one cancels, and a throw with no success and a one on
 *     it botches, which misses whatever it counted.
 *   - Damage dice counted against the damage target with nothing else to them, automatic successes,
 *     and soak by kind of harm, thrown or taken off the dice, never below zero and never thrown for a
 *     blow that counted nothing.
 *   - The wound penalty and a condition's modifier, as dice off the pool; a roll that leans thrown twice
 *     with the better kept; saves and contests as pools; a held hit checked again against successes.
 *   - Initiative thrown again every round, with the modifier as it stands then.
 *   - What one combatant may spend of a pool per turn.
 *   - The forecast, exact on a pool small enough to count by hand.
 *   - A bestiary creature's soak surviving the copy into a stat block.
 *   - Every import refusal, the 1.47 install gate and the log lines.
