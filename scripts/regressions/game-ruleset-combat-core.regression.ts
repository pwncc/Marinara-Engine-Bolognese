/**
 * Ruleset combat, slice C1: the `combat` block and the pure resolver behind it.
 *
 * What is pinned here:
 *   - The FORMAT is not shaped around one game system. Every rule below is proven twice: once on
 *     the 5e draft (a d20 against a defense, with lucky faces, criticals, saves, slots, conditions,
 *     concentration and death saves) and once on Ember Roads (two six-sided dice, no advantage, no
 *     lucky faces, no saves at all and one thing to do a turn).
 *   - Every name the block carries points at something the sheet declares, and at the right sort of
 *     thing: a pool, a field, a column of the list it names, a save, a condition, a track.
 *   - The menu is the only place legality lives. An ability whose price the sheet would refuse is
 *     not on it, and a choice that is not on it changes nothing and says why.
 *   - Every event carries the numbers it was decided by, so a log can print the arithmetic.
 *   - A party member's health, resources, conditions and concentration are the SHEET'S, written
 *     through `applyRulesetSheetOp`, so the fight and the sheet never disagree.
 *   - The state is plain JSON: a fight carried through `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))` mid-battle
 *     resolves the next step identically.
 *   - Combat and the new `mechanics` keys are Capability API 1.26.
