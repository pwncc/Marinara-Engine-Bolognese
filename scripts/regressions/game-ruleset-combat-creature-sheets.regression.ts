/**
 * Creatures written in the ruleset's OWN terms (#6610): a bestiary entry may carry a `sheet`.
 *
 * What is pinned here:
 *   - One place for every number. A creature with a sheet gives none of `health`, `defense`,
 *     `initiativeModifier`, `speed`, `abilities` or `saves` beside it; one without a sheet gives the
 *     three a fight cannot do without, and at least one action.
 *   - Every id on the sheet is one the ruleset declares, and a picked row names a catalog that really
 *     feeds its list.
 *   - Built exactly as a party member is: defense, saves, initiative, speed, health and every attack
 *     and ability on its lists, on the 5e draft AND on Ember Roads, which has three abilities, no
 *     saving throws and health called Grit.
 *   - It pays out of its own pools, and is offered the bigger ways of paying, by the Engine's picker
 *     and in a Game Master's decision alike.
 *   - On a wound track its health IS the track, and its own resistances soften a blow before it
 *     marks one.
 *   - It is an opponent all the same: out at zero rather than dying, no death track on screen, none
 *     of its sheet sent to a screen, and never written back as anybody's sheet, even a party
 *     member's who shares its name.
 *   - A sheet that adds up to no health is left out of the fight with a reason of its own.
 *   - An invented enemy that is not a boss keeps only the entries its ruleset opens to its sheet (the
 *     spell list by class), and the choices it left open are filled by its temperament and
 *     competence, only with what it can pay for, the same way every time. A boss is written in full.
 *   - A Game Master's invention may be a sheet too, so an invented mage has slots and spells: read
 *     leniently (what the ruleset lacks is dropped by name, a row named after a catalog entry IS that
 *     entry), health held into the tier's band through the one field it is read off, and defense,
 *     to-hit, save difficulties and the best round (the biggest affordable payment included) held
 *     on the built combatant.
 *   - The catalogs a bestiary's sheets read are found by id, and a bestiary with no sheets asks for
 *     nothing more.
 *   - Capability API 1.34, inline and in a catalog file.
