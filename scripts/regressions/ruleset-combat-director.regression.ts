/**
 * Ruleset combat, slice C3a: the director's third style, driven with no database and no network.
 *
 * What is pinned here:
 *   - ONE ledger. The ruleset fight is a style of the existing director session, and the Engine's
 *     own `party` and `enemies` arrays are kept in step with it after every step, because the
 *     recap, the journal and the client's end-of-battle path read them.
 *   - The server decides what everybody's numbers are. A party member's come off their own sheet,
 *     and one without a sheet is refused by name rather than given Engine numbers. An opponent's
 *     come off a bestiary, off a clamped proposal or off the ruleset's own threat scale, in that
 *     order, and every adjustment is said out loud.
 *   - A refusal changes nothing at all and carries the resolver's own reason in a stable code.
 *   - `continue` resolves exactly one turn of whoever the player is not playing, and stops.
 *   - The picker never spends the same budget twice, never stalls and always ends the turn.
 *   - The view is a PROJECTION: no sheet build, no live blob, no catalogs, no seed.
 *   - The state is plain JSON: a fight carried through a round trip mid-battle continues on the
 *     same dice.
 *   - Nothing is shaped around one game system: every case is proven on the 5e draft AND on Ember
 *     Roads, which rolls two six-sided dice, has one thing to do a turn and no saving throws.
