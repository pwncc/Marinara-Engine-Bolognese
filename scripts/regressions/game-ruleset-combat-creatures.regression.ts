/**
 * Ruleset combat, slice C2: bestiary catalogs, the actions a creature carries and the threat clamp.
 *
 * What is pinned here:
 *   - A catalog holds rows OR creatures, never a mix, and an entry carries rows OR a creature,
 *     never both and never neither. A catalog of creatures declares no feeds, needs a combat block,
 *     and is never offered by the sheet editor's picker.
 *   - Every name a creature carries is one the ruleset already has: a budget, a save, a condition,
 *     a damage type, a threat tier, and, for a sequence, another action of the same block that is
 *     not itself a sequence.
 *   - Health written as dice is thrown once, when the encounter is created, and the average is what
 *     a forecast reads.
 *   - A sequence spends ONE budget and resolves each part with its own roll and its own target.
 *   - Limited uses run out, a recharge comes back on the right face and not on a lower one, and a
 *     signature action is priced in the creature's own points and refused when they are short.
 *   - An opponent nobody wrote is clamped onto the ruleset's scale, and says in plain words what it
 *     changed; one already in scale comes back untouched.
 *   - The FORMAT is not shaped around one game system: every rule is proven on the 5e draft and on
 *     Ember Roads, which has no saving throws, no declared damage types and one budget.
 *   - Bestiaries are Capability API 1.27, inline and in a catalog file.
