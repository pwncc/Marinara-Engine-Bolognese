/**
 * Ruleset combat, slice C5g (#6728): the moment after an attack hits, and creatures that react.
 *
 * What is pinned here:
 *   - `on: "hit"`: an attack roll that hits somebody holding an answer for it is HELD before its
 *     damage, and a window asks the one it hit. What they take counts for that attack: the same roll
 *     is checked again against their defense as it now stands, a hit that no longer reaches it
 *     misses, and a natural face still decides whatever the defense.
 *   - The held attack picks up exactly where it stopped: the rest of its targets, the rest of an
 *     action made of other actions, whoever it had already hurt (for the moment after it), and a
 *     fight saved while the window is open.
 *   - Nothing opened inside a window opens another, so an attack made inside one is never held.
 *   - A creature's own action may be a reaction and land on the creature itself (a Parry), and a
 *     one-attack guard it puts on is spent by the attack it answered.
 *   - `rulesetAnswerDeflects`, which the Engine's picker reads: true only when the answer turns the
 *     hit into a miss.
 *   - Every import refusal, the log, and the 1.46 gate.
