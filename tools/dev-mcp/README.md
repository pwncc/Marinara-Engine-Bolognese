# dev-mcp: a developer MCP server for Marinara Engine

Version 1.0.0

`tools/dev-mcp` is an **optional developer tool**. It is a small [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets a coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, or any other MCP client) look inside a Marinara Engine running on your machine and, when you allow it, change and restart it. Nothing in the app depends on it: it is not part of the pnpm workspace, it is not built or shipped, and you can ignore or delete the folder without affecting anything.

## Why it exists

When you work on the engine with an agent, a lot of time goes into things the agent cannot see directly:

| Today                                                                             | With dev-mcp                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Search the server's JSON log lines by hand for the reference from an error toast. | `lookup_error` takes the `errorId` (or the `x-request-id` header) and returns the matching lines with stack traces plus the whole request trail, in order, ending with its `request.end` line. |
| Scroll through warnings to find what keeps failing.                               | `logs` groups warnings and errors by event and message, with counts and the last errorId / requestId to follow.                                                                                |
| Guess why the prompt cache hit rate dropped.                                      | `cache_report` shows the hit % per reply; `diff_prompts` shows exactly where two prompts start to differ, which is where the provider's prefix cache breaks.                                   |
| Check whether a card or rule really reaches the model by adding debug logging.    | `get_prompt` returns the exact request the engine saved for a reply, or a free preview of the next turn (no model call), with an outline and a text search.                                    |
| Stop the server by hand, rebuild, start it again, hope nothing else was running.  | `restart_engine` takes a lock, waits until nobody is mid-turn, backs up `dist`, builds, relaunches, and rolls back to the previous build if the build fails.                                   |
| Try a risky change on your real data.                                             | `sandbox_refresh` starts a sanitized copy of your data on another port, with every credential removed, so experiments cannot touch real chats or spend model quota.                            |

## Tools

| Area              | Tools                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Orientation       | `engine_status` (running?, process chain, the engine's own startup summary from `/api/health` or the `startup.ready` log line, build times, git state, lock, seconds since the last generation, recent activity), `git_status`, `activity_log` |
| Chats             | `list_chats`, `read_messages`, `chat_settings` (connection, preset, game special instructions with length vs the 2000-character limit)                                                                                                         |

| Diagnostics       | `logs`, `lookup_error`, `list_connections` (never returns keys or base URLs)                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Settings          | `set_chat_metadata` (backup first; 2000-character guard for special instructions; `dryRun`)                                                                                                                                                    |
| Development       | `typecheck`, `run_regressions`, `build`, `restart_engine`, `api_request` (GET freely; anything else needs `confirm` and a reason)                                                                                                              |
| Sandbox           | `sandbox_refresh`, `sandbox_stop`                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Every tool has a description the agent reads, so you rarely need to explain them. Read-only tools are marked with the MCP `readOnlyHint` annotation, and build / restart / raw API calls with `destructiveHint`, so clients that ask before risky calls can do so.

## Setup

Requirements: Node.js 20 or newer (the engine itself needs 24), a built engine checkout, and git on the PATH.

```sh
cd tools/dev-mcp
npm install
```

Use `npm install` (or `pnpm install --ignore-workspace`) inside this folder. The folder is deliberately not a workspace package, so the root `pnpm install` does not install it and the app build never sees it.

Then register the server with your client. The server talks over stdio; the command is always `node <repo>/tools/dev-mcp/server.mjs`.

**Claude Code**

```sh
claude mcp add marinara-dev -e MARINARA_DEV_AGENT=claude-code -- node /path/to/Marinara-Engine/tools/dev-mcp/server.mjs
```

**Codex** (`~/.codex/config.toml`)

```toml
[mcp_servers.marinara-dev]
command = "node"
args = ["/path/to/Marinara-Engine/tools/dev-mcp/server.mjs"]
env = { MARINARA_DEV_AGENT = "codex" }
```

**Any other MCP client** (the common JSON shape)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "marinara-dev": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/Marinara-Engine/tools/dev-mcp/server.mjs"],
      "env": { "MARINARA_DEV_AGENT": "my-agent" }
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows, use forward slashes or escaped backslashes in the path.

To work in the sandbox as well, register a second copy with `MARINARA_DEV_INSTANCE=sandbox` (for example under the name `marinara-sandbox`). Every tool then points at the sandbox port instead of the live engine.

### Settings

All optional. The defaults suit a normal checkout.

| Variable                    | Default                                | Meaning                                                                                         |

| `MARINARA_DEV_STATE`        | `<repo>/.dev-mcp`                      | Backups, lock, activity log, saved prompts, large outputs, the sandbox                          |
| `MARINARA_DEV_AGENT`        | `unknown-agent`                        | Name written to the activity log and the lock; give each client its own                         |
| `MARINARA_DEV_INSTANCE`     | `live`                                 | `sandbox` points every tool at the sandbox                                                      |
| `MARINARA_DEV_PORT`         | `PORT` from the repo `.env`, else 7860 | Engine port                                                                                     |
| `MARINARA_DEV_SANDBOX_PORT` | 7862                                   | Sandbox port                                                                                    |
| `MARINARA_DEV_SANDBOX_DIR`  | `<state>/sandbox`                      | Sandbox folder                                                                                  |
| `MARINARA_DEV_SANDBOX_DIST` | `dist`                                 | Server build folder the sandbox runs when none is given and none was recorded by an earlier run |
| `MARINARA_DEV_PNPM`         | `corepack pnpm`                        | How to run pnpm for builds (plain words and paths only; no shell characters)                    |

The port and the data and log folders are read from the engine's env file (`PORT`, `DATA_DIR`, `LOG_DIR`) the same way the server resolves them: `MARINARA_ENV_FILE` when it is set in the tool's environment (engines the tool starts inherit it), else the repo `.env`.

**`.dev-mcp/` holds backups of your cards and chat settings and copies of prompts, which can contain your own campaign text. It must stay out of git:** the root `.gitignore` lists `.dev-mcp/`. If you point `MARINARA_DEV_STATE` somewhere else, keep that folder private too.

## Logs, and what works best with the logging changes

The log tools (`logs`, `lookup_error`, the startup summary in `engine_status`, and the quiet wait before a restart) read the engine's JSON log lines. They look in two places:

1. `marinara-*.log` files in the engine's log folder (`LOG_DIR`, else `<data>/logs`), for engines that write log files.
2. Otherwise, the output this tool captured for an engine it started itself with `restart_engine` (`.dev-mcp/run/live-server.out.log`) or for the sandbox (`.dev-mcp/sandbox/sandbox.log`). In production the engine prints the same JSON lines to stdout, so starting the engine through `restart_engine` once is enough to give these tools something to read.

The tool works against any recent engine, and works best with the request-trail logging from the engine foundations series (issue #6624). With it, every line a request causes carries `requestId`, error toasts and API errors carry an `errorId`, responses send `x-request-id`, and startup writes a `startup.ready` summary. Without it:

- `lookup_error` still finds the lines that contain the reference, and follows Fastify's own `reqId` (`req-1`, `req-2`, ...; it restarts with each boot, so a trail can mix runs), but the trail is shorter and there is no `errorId` to look up.
- `engine_status` shows `startup: null`.
- The quiet wait uses Fastify's `incoming request` lines for `/api/generate` and `/api/game/...`. Those are written at `info`, so they need `LOG_LEVEL=info` (the default is `warn`) and request logging on. Otherwise the quiet wait finds no recent generation and does not wait, so check that nobody is mid-reply before a restart.
- `logs` still groups the warnings and errors the engine writes at its default level.
- Failed `api_request` calls do not name a `requestId`.

## Typical loops

- **A bad reply**: `read_messages`, then `get_prompt grep="..."` (is the card or rule really in the prompt?), then `edit_character` or `set_chat_metadata`, then `get_prompt which=next grep="..."` to confirm. No model call is needed.
- **The cache hit rate dropped**: `cache_report`, then `diff_prompts` (last two replies) or `diff_prompts mode=next`, then fix whatever changes above the break point.
- **A code change that affects prompts**: `get_prompt which=next` (saves a file), edit code, `typecheck`, `run_regressions filter=...`, `restart_engine rebuild=["server"]`, then `diff_prompts fileA=<saved file>`.
- **Test a server change without touching the live engine**: build it into `packages/server/dist-sandbox`, run `sandbox_refresh dist=dist-sandbox`, and compare `get_prompt which=next` snapshots with `diff_prompts`.
- **An error toast**: `lookup_error reference=<errorId>`. For a failed call the agent made itself, the error message already names the `requestId` to pass.

## Safety

- **Read tools are free.** They only read the API and the log files.
- **Backups before writes.** `edit_character` saves the whole card and `set_chat_metadata` saves the previous values under `.dev-mcp/backups` before changing anything. Character edits also go through the engine's own version history with your reason. Both accept `dryRun`.
- **Activity log.** Every write, build and restart made through the server is appended to `.dev-mcp/activity.jsonl` with the agent name and reason. Agents can add notes with `activity_log` for changes they made elsewhere, which helps when several agents share one engine.
- **Engine lock.** `restart_engine` and `build` hold the lock while they run and refuse to start while another session holds it (each server process is its own session, even with the same agent name). The lock is taken atomically and refreshed during long waits and builds; a lock not refreshed for 45 minutes counts as abandoned.
- **Quiet wait.** By default `restart_engine` waits until nobody has generated for 150 seconds (up to 30 minutes), so it never cuts off a reply in progress. Pass `waitForQuiet: false` to skip that.
- **Build rollback.** Every touched `dist` folder is copied before a build (the last five copies are kept). A failed build, or a server build that is missing compiled files, restores the previous `dist` and relaunches it. Stale `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` files are deleted before each build, since they can make `tsc` emit nothing.
- **Never through `start.bat` or `start.sh`.** Both launchers run `git clean -fd` on `packages/*/src` before starting, which deletes untracked source files you are working on. The tool starts the server the way the launchers' last step does: `node ../../scripts/run-server.mjs dist/index.js` in `packages/server`, with `NODE_ENV=production` and browser auto-open off.
- **Stops only this checkout's engine.** Before stopping anything, the tool checks that the process on the port looks like the engine (run-server, `dist/index.js`, or a launcher) and that it belongs to this checkout: it is the process this tool started on that port, its working directory is inside the repository, or its command names a launcher or build path inside the repository. Anything else on that port is left alone, with an error that says so.
- **Raw API writes need consent.** `api_request` with any method other than GET needs `confirm: true` and a reason, and is logged.
- **No secrets in output.** `list_connections` returns only ids, providers, models, names and default flags.
- **Bounded output.** Long results are cut, and the full text is saved under `.dev-mcp/out` with the path returned, so an agent's context is never flooded.
- **No arbitrary file reads.** `diff_prompts` reads saved prompt files only from inside the state folder, and ids used in backup and prompt file names are reduced to safe characters.

### The sandbox

`sandbox_refresh` copies the live store (tables only, not images or other assets; `.bak` files and the writer lease are skipped) into `.dev-mcp/sandbox`, sanitizes the copy, and starts it on port 7862. The live store is only read. Isolation comes in layers:

- Every credential-looking field in the copied connections table is blanked, and every remote base URL is pointed at a closed local port, so even a provider that answers without a key is unreachable.
- Discord and other webhook settings are removed from copied chats.
- The sandbox process gets its own `DATA_DIR`, `FILE_STORAGE_DIR`, `LOG_DIR` and env file, binds to `127.0.0.1`, cannot apply updates (`UPDATES_APPLY_DISABLED`), and does not seed a default connection.
- `HOME`, `USERPROFILE`, `APPDATA`, `LOCALAPPDATA`, `XDG_*`, `CODEX_HOME` and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` point into the sandbox, so subscription logins (ChatGPT through Codex, Claude Code, CLI providers) do not exist there.
- Environment variables whose names look like credentials (keys, tokens, secrets, passwords, sessions) are not passed on.
- The tool refuses to run the sandbox until a sanitize pass has finished, and refuses any layout where the sandbox data folder is the live data folder or inside it, also after resolving links.
- Linked folders and files in the live store (a `storage` folder on another drive, say) are copied as independent files. The copy is checked for links before it is sanitized, so a sanitize pass can never write through to the live store.
- In sandbox mode the server never writes the checkout's `dist`: `build` and `restart_engine rebuild` are refused, and `typecheck` does not rebuild `shared`.

The result: the sandbox cannot spend model quota or post anywhere. Use it for prompt previews, cache diagnosis, UI checks, code verification and restart testing; real model replies are not possible there by design. Background agents will log connection warnings in the sandbox, which is expected.

What has been exercised: Windows 11 against a running engine (read tools and process lookup), and the start, stop and sandbox paths on Windows 11 and on Linux (Ubuntu under WSL 2) against a stand-in server on spare ports. macOS uses the same code as Linux (`lsof` and `ps` behave the same way there) but has not been run. Docker and Termux installs are not supported for `restart_engine` and the sandbox: inside a container, restart the container instead; the read tools work anywhere the API and log folder are reachable.

## Limits

- The engine keeps the exact saved request only for the most recent replies of a chat; older turns have none. Take `get_prompt which=next` snapshots going forward.
- On Windows the stop is forced (`taskkill /F`), because console servers ignore a polite `taskkill`. A write in flight at that moment can be lost, which is one more reason the quiet wait is on by default.
- A cold start of a large install can take several minutes; `restart_engine` waits up to 12 minutes for `/api/health`.
- `lookup_error` reads the newest 10 log files. References older than the retained logs are gone.
- The sandbox copy is a snapshot. Run `sandbox_refresh` again to pick up newer data.
- The lock and the activity log coordinate agents that use this server. They cannot see someone restarting the engine by hand.

## Smoke test

```sh
node test/smoke.mjs ["chat name or id"]
```

It starts the server over stdio, checks that every tool is listed, and calls the read tools (and `edit_character` / `set_chat_metadata` only with `dryRun`). It never writes, builds or restarts. Online checks are skipped when the engine is not running.

## Isolation tests

```sh
node test/isolation.mjs
```

Offline and self-contained: each case builds a throwaway checkout in the temp folder and never touches a real engine, dist or data. They check that a sandbox refresh with a linked live storage folder or shard leaves every live file unchanged, that a stop refuses a listener it cannot tie to this checkout (and still stops this checkout's own supervisor), and that no build entry point writes the dist in sandbox mode.
