 *  set — while the EXAMPLE is one concrete, parseable instance. Collapsing them, as this renderer

 *  the weather reaches for "sunny" or "clear", the validator refuses a word that was never shown to
 *  it, and the failure is silent — the tag is stripped on the name match, so the narration reads
 *  clean and the world simply never changed.
 *
 *  Deriving the vocabulary here rather than asking a package to spell it in its description is what
 *  keeps the two from drifting: the prompt and the validator now read the same parsed table, so an
 *  enum that changes changes both, and a description cannot promise a value the validator refuses.
 *
 *  One line per verb, never wrapped — the convention every built-in in the block already follows
 *  (`gm-prompts.ts:768` runs past 700 characters on one line). The render needs no length budget of
