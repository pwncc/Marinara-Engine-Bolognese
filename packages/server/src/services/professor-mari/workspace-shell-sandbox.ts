// The deny list above is spawn-time-only: a command can create a NEW
// sensitive-by-name file (a package.json in a fresh directory, a root
// Dockerfile that was absent) with no rule attached and no review. The
// pre-command heuristics catch common write shapes, but they are string
// checks by design. These functions are the net under all of it: a
// fingerprint of every sensitive file before the command, and a re-walk
// after it, so an unreviewed write is detected no matter what command shape
// produced it.
//
// Hardening rules (adversarial review, #5786):
// - Only REGULAR files are ever opened. A symlink is fingerprinted by its
//   own identity and never followed - this scan runs in the unsandboxed
//   server process, and following a link named package.json would read
//   arbitrary host files into an approval card (or hang on a FIFO, or read
//   /dev/zero unboundedly). Special files get the same treatment.
// - Failures are contained PER ENTRY: a file the command chmod'd unreadable
//   still produces a (diffable) fingerprint instead of aborting the walk,
//   so its co-created siblings are still caught and reverted.
// - Content is retained as raw BYTES (a utf8 round-trip corrupts binary
//   lockfiles like bun.lockb on restore), up to the review cap; grossly
//   oversized files are fingerprinted by size alone and never read.
