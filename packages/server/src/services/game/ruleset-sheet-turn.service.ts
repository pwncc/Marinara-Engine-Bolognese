// Game: one turn of a ruleset game's live sheet state
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// The Game Master records what happens to a character sheet with `[sheet: ...]` commands. The
// Engine owns the arithmetic: every command is checked against the live state the turn started
// with, applied or refused, and written back into the saved reply with its outcome. The live state
// itself rides the game-state snapshot of the message and swipe, so a swipe or a regenerated turn
// starts from the state before it and can never spend twice.
