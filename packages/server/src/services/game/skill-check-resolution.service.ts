 * tag whose plain-d20 arithmetic fails the audit. The second is the case this
 * function exists for — before it, a GM that invented `rolls="7" total="19"` had
 * its numbers corrected on the dice card and left standing in the saved text, so
 * the next turn read back the invention as fact.
 *
 * Idempotent: what it writes parses back as an audited result, so a second pass
 * over the same content rewrites nothing and rolls no dice. The one exception is a
 * `dice-pool` RULESET's check, whose numbers are never vouched for and would be rolled
 * again; generation only ever hands this function a freshly written segment. Pool systems
 * (`resolution="successes"`, non-d20 `dice=`) are never audited and never
 * rewritten — the engine does not implement those rules and will not pretend to.
 * That holds for a malformed pool tag as much as a tidy one: the shared reader
 * refusing to vouch for a pool's numbers is not permission to answer it with a
 * d20, so `isEngineRollableSkillCheckTag` is asked before anything is rolled.
 *
 * **It does not throw, and that is the point.** The failure this owns is the
 * chat's modifiers not loading, and the caller's only two options used to be
 * losing the turn or saving it unchanged — and unchanged means saving the
 * model's invented `rolls="7" total="19"` on a check nobody rolled, which the
 * next turn reads back as fact. That is the exact dishonesty the engine took the
 * die away to end, arrived at through the error path instead of the happy one.
 * So a roll that cannot happen writes the tags back SPARSE: the ask the GM made,
 * the numbers dropped, nothing invented in their place. The turn survives, the
 * transcript stays honest, and the check reads back as still owing a roll — so
 * the client's own fallback can ask for one.
