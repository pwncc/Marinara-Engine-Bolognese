// What a won fight drops, in every Game Mode game (#6758, #6894).
//
// One rule decides where it comes from. A ruleset that declares loot tables drops its own items: each
// defeated bestiary creature rolls the table it names. Otherwise, while the game's native items are on
// (no ruleset, or one that leaves them on), Game Mode's own tables drop their items, more and rarer on
// a harder game. A ruleset that turns its native items off and declares no tables drops nothing.
//
// Planned before the chat's queue is held, then added inside the caller's transaction, so a fight's
// last step and what it drops are written together, or neither is.
