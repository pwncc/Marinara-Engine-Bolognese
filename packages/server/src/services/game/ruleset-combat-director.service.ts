// Game: the director's third style, a fight the ruleset resolves itself

// The same ledger as the other two styles: one storage row, one revision, one request-id guard and
// one per-chat queue. Only what happens inside a step is different, and all of it goes through the
// pure resolver in `@marinara-engine/shared`: the menu decides legality, the dice come from the
// session's own seed and cursor, and everything a party member spends or loses is written through
// the sheet's own rules.
//
// Everything here is pure over `(definition, state)` so a regression can drive a whole fight with
// no database and no network. The two things that are not pure, reading the ruleset and writing the
// party's live sheet state back, live in the route.
