/**
 * Asking a local chat model the same yes/no question System One answers.
 *
 * One chat completion per question, with `max_tokens: 1`, and the probability read out
 * of the first token's log-probabilities. No grammar or `json_schema` constraint: a
 * constraint can change what `top_logprobs` reports, and the prompt plus a one-token
 * budget is already enough.
 *
 * The shared state goes first and the question last, so llama-server's prompt cache is
 * reused across every question of one group.
 *
 * A chat-model Decision connection is asked exactly the same way, at the URL the user
 * entered and under the provider URL policy. A managed slot's requests never leave the
 * machine. Nothing throws: a target that cannot answer returns no answer for that
 * agent, and the gate runs it.
