/**
 * Decision statements in prompt conditionals: `{{#if decision:"..."}}` and
 * `{{#if decision_choice:"..." == "option"}}`.
 *
 * The macro engine is synchronous, so a statement cannot be asked while a condition is
 * evaluated. Instead the turn's statements are found in the prompt sources first,
 * asked in one batch, and handed to the engine as answers. Only statements the turn
 * can reach are asked (#6582): the parts of a preset it uses, the choices selected,
 * lorebook entries that activate, and blocks nothing else has already ruled out. The engine then looks each
 * one up wherever it is evaluated: a preset section, a card field, a group block, a
 * per-responder pass, a lorebook entry. A statement with no answer reads as false, so a
 * prompt with no Decision model behaves exactly as it did before this existed.
 *
 * Answers are cached for the turn, so a regeneration, a swipe and Peek Prompt all see
 * the same branches, and the model is only asked again when a new message arrives.
