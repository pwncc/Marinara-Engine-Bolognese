/**
 * Resolving a local model slot into something that can answer a decision.
 *
 * Both slots already own their lifecycle — the main sidecar through
 * `sidecarProcessService`, the utility slot through `utilitySidecarService` — so this
 * asks each for its base URL and leaves starting, stopping and error reporting where
 * they are. It never couples the two: each is reached through its own entry point,
 * for the reason the utility provider's header comment gives.
 *
 * The request itself is a plain POST rather than a trip through a provider, because
 * `openai.provider.ts` drops `logprobs` and `top_logprobs` unless a caller sets them
 * explicitly, and the whole method depends on those two fields arriving intact.
