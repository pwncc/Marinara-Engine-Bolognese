/**
 * The managed decision sidecar's process.
 *
 * A second, separate local process: it does not replace or share anything with the
 * llama.cpp sidecar, so a chat or tracker model can keep running beside it.
 *
 * It is launched on port 0 and its real port is read from the line the server prints
 * on stdout once the model is loaded. That is deliberate. Picking a free port here and
 * passing it in leaves a window where something else takes it, and polling `/health`
 * to decide readiness would mean guessing the port first. The upstream server prints
 * `{"url": ..., "model": ..., "method": ...}` after `load_predictor` returns, so one
 * line answers both questions with no race.
