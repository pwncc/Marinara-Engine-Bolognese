/**
 * #5838 field finding: a SteamOS box's earlyoom sent SIGTERM and our graceful
 * shutdown took 39 seconds, because shutdown() awaits app.close() without any
 * bound and Fastify's close waits for open connections - a phone browser
 * holding an SSE stream is enough. earlyoom gives roughly 10 seconds before
 * treating the stop as failed; Docker and systemd have their own stop
 * timeouts. Past any of them, an orderly stop becomes a SIGKILL that drops
 * the store's debounced writes.
 *
 * Two stages, mirroring the pattern admin.routes.ts already used for its
 * restart: first sever open connections so close() can proceed to the onClose
 * flush (the gentle remedy for the observed hang), then - only if close is
 * still stuck, e.g. inside the flush itself - exit outright, because whatever
 * has not finished by then is exactly what the supervisor was about to
 * SIGKILL anyway, except we leave on our own terms with the session exit
 * stamp already recorded.
