// What a positioned ruleset fight's board shows, with no React in it.
//
// The server sends the whole board: the terrain, where everybody stands, which cells the walk may
// end on and what each one costs, who a path would be struck at by, who an option may be pointed
// at, and which cells a shape may be aimed at with everybody each aim would catch. Nothing here
// measures a distance, decides who may be hit or works out whether a step is legal: it reads the
// view, indexes it by cell, and hands a component one row per square.
//
// The one number this file turns into another is the ruleset's own: a count of cells becomes the
// ruleset's own distance by its own `perCell`, so the screen says "20 ft" or "8 paces" rather than
// a cell count nobody at the table would recognise.
