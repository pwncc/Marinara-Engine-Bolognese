// Game Mode rulesets: layers
//
// A layer is a variant the ruleset ships inside its own file (Low magic, Hard winter). The player
// turns layers on when the game is created, the choice is frozen into the pin's `options` record,
// and the server applies them in one place, so the prompt, the resolver, the sheet editor and the
// battle bridge all see the effective rules with no change of their own.
//
// Everything here is pure and nothing throws. A game must never lose its ruleset to a layer, so a
// layer whose result the Engine could not read is skipped and the rest of the game goes on.
