// Live state of a ruleset character sheet: the part of a sheet that changes during play, on top of
// the static build the sheet editor writes.
//
// It is stored SPARSE and read TOLERANTLY. Only a value somebody changed is stored; everything else
// reads as its declared default, so a pool that starts full follows its maximum when a level-up
// raises it, and junk in the stored blob costs that one entry rather than the whole sheet. Writes
// normalise the other way: a value back at its default drops out of the store again, so it starts
// following the maximum once more.
//
// Nothing here is system-specific. Every pool, track, text field, condition and rest comes from the
// definition, so a 2d6 game whose only pool is an empty-start "stress" track works exactly as well
// as a d20 game with spell slots.

// The rules, written down here because a vague implementation produces the wrong track:
//
// - A SEQUENTIAL track (the default) holds its marks SORTED, MOST SEVERE FIRST. A track of 7 levels
//   holds at most 7 marks. A mark is PLACED IN SEVERITY ORDER among the marks already there, never
//   appended: it takes the highest level its severity earns and pushes lighter marks down.
// - An INDEXED track puts a mark on the box the command names, or the next free one above it, and
//   never moves a mark once it is down. With no such box free the whole command is refused.
// - The PENALTY IN FORCE on named levels is the one on the LOWEST MARKED LEVEL, not the sum of the
//   marked ones, and no marks means no penalty. On boxes it is the track's table read at the number
//   of boxes filled or remaining, whatever that number is.
// - An `amount` is a number of marks of one kind, APPLIED ONE AT A TIME, so a track that fills
//   partway through is handled by the same rule as one that was already full.
// - Marking a FULL track UPGRADES ITS LOWEST-SEVERITY MARK by one step instead of adding a mark.
//   The incoming kind is not what it upgrades to: one step up the declared ladder is. A mark that
//   would upgrade past the highest severity is kept at the highest, and the one that could not land
//   is counted as an OVERFLOW, which is persisted. A track that says `onFull: "refuse"` refuses the
//   whole command instead, and an indexed track always does.
// - HEALING is the same op with a negative amount, clearing the LIGHTEST marks first (on an indexed
//   track, the highest box among equally light ones). Naming a kind clears only marks of that kind.
//   Overflow clears before marks do, either way.
// - A track may be shorter for this character than the marks stored on it (a row that added levels
//   was deleted). The marks that no longer fit are overflow, not forgotten: harm is not undone by
//   editing the sheet.
