// A Game Master's invented opponent, written as a SHEET, held to its tier.
//
// A plain invention is held by its numbers before the fight is built (`clampRulesetStatBlock`). A
// sheet has no numbers until it is built: its defense, to-hit, save difficulties and damage are
// whatever the ruleset's own formulas make of it. So it is held in three steps, each the smallest
// thing that works for any ruleset:
//
//   1. `readProposedRulesetSheet`: a model's sheet is read the way a character's is, leniently.
//      Anything the ruleset does not have is dropped by name, a value is fitted to its field or
//      column, and a row named after a catalog entry becomes that entry, so "Fireball" is Fireball.
//      For anything but a boss, `restrictRulesetSheetEntries` then keeps only the entries the ruleset
//      opens to that sheet (a Sorcerer's spells, not every spell), and `fillRulesetSheetChoices`
//      fills the choices it left open by its temperament and competence, with no model call.
//   2. `holdRulesetSheetHealth`: health goes into the tier's band through the one field the
//      ruleset's health is read off, which is a sheet edit, so every reader agrees on it.
//   3. `holdRulesetCombatant`: once the fight is built, defense, to-hit, save difficulties and the
//      best round are held on the combatant itself, which is where those numbers live for the whole
//      fight. The damage a bigger payment buys counts toward the best round.
//
// Every change comes back as a plain sentence, exactly as the plain clamp's do.
