/**
 * A second, independent local model slot.
 *
 * The existing sidecar holds exactly one model and is wired to generation, scene
 * analysis and tracker agents. Some agents want a small purpose-trained model of
 * their own — an extractor, say — and installing that into the main slot would
 * displace whatever the operator is already running there.
 *
 * So this is a parallel slot: its own config file, its own model directory, its own
 * llama-server process on its own port. It reuses the installed llama.cpp runtime
 * read-only and shares nothing else. Nothing here reads or writes the main sidecar's
 * configuration, model files, process or connections.
