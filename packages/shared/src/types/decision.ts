 * out of the first token's log-probabilities, so a user who never wants a second model
 * or a paid API can still gate their agents.
 *
 * Local slots are pseudo-connections with no stored row, following `SIDECAR_CONNECTION_ID`.
 * Which one is selected is a single app setting rather than a flag on each slot's own
 * config, because the choice is exclusive across all of them and three booleans in three
