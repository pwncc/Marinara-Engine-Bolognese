// 1.10: contributions.assets — general package-owned static asset delivery.
// 1.11: Experience combat seam — combatActive/combatStyle/requestCombat on the
//        game-surface capabilityProps.
// 1.12: spatial transition commit/reject/refresh capability events are also
//        addressed to the game-owning Experience package (soft seam: delivered
//        regardless of declared capabilityApi; declare 1.12 only to REQUIRE it).
// 1.13: setExperienceChrome accepts requestsCollapsedNarration — a transient request
//        to fold the Game narration box down to its handle for a cutscene beat. It
//        never writes the player's stored preference and the engine's safety rules
//        still force the box open when it holds something to act on.
// 1.14: roleplay-tracker and tracker-panel UI contribution slots, package-aware
//        prompt placement, and package-agent post-processing lifecycle hooks.
// 1.15: packages can resolve their current embedding connection without reactivation.
// 1.16: package-declared Game Master verbs — a hash-pinned `gm-verbs.json` asset the engine renders
//        into the GM prompt, parses back out of the turn, and either writes into the package's own
//        chat-metadata key or delivers live as a `gm_verb` event (soft seam: read from the asset
//        regardless of declared capabilityApi; declare 1.16 only to REQUIRE it. Needs `chat-write`).
// 1.17: opted-in Experience surfaces prepare before startup and supply first-turn world context.
// 1.18: Experience seed/default declarations in the Engine setup wizard.
// 1.19: package-contributed tools — a package holding `tools` registers a named tool through
//        `api.registerTool`, and the engine offers it to the model alongside the built-ins on every
//        turn, validates the call against the package's own JSON Schema, and hands the arguments to
//        the package's handler. Not a soft seam: the API only exists on an engine this new, so a
//        package that needs it must declare 1.19. Needs `tools`.
// 1.20: Game Mode rulesets — a hash-pinned `ruleset.json` asset the engine validates as data and
//        offers as a game's rules (resolution kind, character sheet, rests, GM guidance). Not a
//        soft seam: a ruleset package is useless on an engine that cannot read it, so declaring
//        the asset requires 1.20 and an older engine refuses the install cleanly. No permission.
// 1.21: ruleset catalogs — a ruleset may ship collections of ready-made entries the sheet editor
//        offers in a picker, inline in `ruleset.json` or as hash-pinned `catalogs/<id>.json`
//        assets beside it. Not a soft seam either, for the same reason as 1.20: an engine that
//        cannot read `catalogs` refuses the whole ruleset file, so a package that ships them
//        declares 1.21 and an older engine refuses the install cleanly. No permission.
// 1.22: the ruleset combat bridge — a ruleset may carry an optional `battle` block naming the live
//        pools a fight reads as hit points, energy and slots, and the sheet lists whose
//        catalog-marked rows become the Engine's own combat skills. Not a soft seam, for the same
//        reason as 1.20 and 1.21: an engine that cannot read `battle` refuses the whole ruleset
//        file, so a package that ships one declares 1.22. No permission.
// 1.23: scaled catalog values — a catalog entry row may carry a `scaled` map naming number columns
//        the ruleset keeps up to date from the sheet (a maximum that follows a level or an ability),
//        each a value reference with an optional step table. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as
//        1.20, 1.21 and 1.22: an engine that cannot read `scaled` refuses the whole ruleset file, or
//        the catalog file that holds it, so a package that ships one declares 1.23. No permission.
// 1.24: the `dice-pool` resolution kind — a ruleset may resolve a check by throwing the sheet's own
//        number of dice and counting the ones that reach a target, with optional doubling,
//        exploding, cancelling, botches, exceptional successes and situational dice. Not a soft
//        seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.23: an engine that knows only `dice-sum`
//        refuses the whole ruleset file, so a package whose ruleset declares the kind declares
//        1.24. No permission.
// 1.25: ruleset layers. A ruleset may declare variants of itself (Low magic, Hard winter) that a
//        player turns on when a game is created, each appending Game Master guidance, narrowing an
//        enum field, swapping the difficulty ladder or hiding catalog entries. The same release
//        gives the base `gm` block a `worldGuidance` slot, read once by world generation. Not a
//        soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.24: an engine that cannot read `layers`
//        or `gm.worldGuidance` refuses the whole ruleset file, so a package that ships either one
//        declares 1.25. No permission.
// 1.26: ruleset combat. A ruleset may carry an optional `combat` block saying how a fight is
//        RESOLVED by its own numbers (what is rolled against what, the action economy, conditions,
//        concentration, dying and the threat scale), and a catalog entry's `mechanics` may say how
//        many targets it takes, that it always lands, what conditions it applies, what temporary
//        points it grants, how it grows with the sheet and which budget it spends. Not a soft seam,
//        for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.25: an Engine that cannot read `combat` or the new
//        `mechanics` keys refuses the whole ruleset file, or the catalog file that holds them, so a
//        package that ships either declares 1.26. No permission.
// 1.27: ruleset bestiaries. A ruleset catalog may declare `"holds": "creatures"` and carry creature
//        stat blocks instead of sheet rows: health that may be dice, a defense, saves, resistances,
//        condition immunities, a threat tier, traits the Game Master is shown and actions with
//        sequences, limited uses, recharge rolls and signature points. Not a soft seam, for the
//        same reason as 1.20 through 1.26: an Engine that cannot read `holds` or `creature` refuses
//        the whole ruleset file, or the catalog file that holds them, so a package that ships
//        either declares 1.27. No permission.
// 1.28: a ruleset fight on a board. A ruleset's `combat` block may say what one cell of a grid is
//        worth in its own distance (`distance`), what shooting past the ordinary distance or beside
//        a foe does (`ranged`), what standing behind something adds to the defense (`cover`) and
//        which budget a strike at somebody walking away is paid out of (`opportunity`); an attack
//        list may give its rows a `reach` and a `range`; and a creature action's `range` may be an
//        ordinary distance with a longer one beyond it. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as
//        1.20 through 1.27: an Engine that cannot read these keys refuses the whole ruleset file,
//        or the catalog file that holds them, so a package that ships any of them declares 1.28.
//        No permission.
// 1.29: what one turn of a ruleset fight can do. A blow may carry a second damage clause
//        (`plus`), an attack list may say how many strikes one spend of its budget buys
//        (`strikes`), a catalog entry may be free of the economy, hand budgets back or let its
//        holder buy a standard action with another budget (`free`, `gives`, `standard`), a new
//        entry kind `rider` and a creature's own `riders` add damage to a qualifying hit, and a
//        condition may narrow the saves it is about, count only while its source is in sight or
//        end when its source goes down. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through
//        1.28: an Engine that cannot read these keys refuses the whole ruleset file, or the
//        catalog file that holds them, so a package that ships any of them declares 1.29.
//        No permission.
// 1.30: wound tracks. A ruleset's `live.tracks` entry may declare `levels` (a column of boxes, each
//        with a label and a penalty) and `kinds` (what a mark on it may be), which turns the track
//        from a bounded integer into a wound track that is marked rather than counted; and
//        `resolution.penaltyFrom` names the track whose penalty rides on every roll, taking dice
//        off a pool or adding a flat modifier to a sum. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as
//        1.20 through 1.29: an Engine that cannot read these keys refuses the whole ruleset file,
//        so a package that ships any of them declares 1.30. No permission.
// 1.31: live host LLM, image and video integrations for downloadable packages.
// 1.32: a weapon that is one strike a turn whatever its wielder's count. An attack source may
//        declare `strikesCappedBy`, a boolean column of its own list that holds ITS row to a single
//        strike however many `strikes` the list buys. SRD 5.1's Loading is the sentence it exists
//        for. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.31: an Engine that cannot read
//        the key refuses the whole ruleset file, so a package that ships it declares 1.32. No
//        permission.
// 1.33: a catalog entry that says WHICH moment it waits for. `mechanics.reaction` may be an object
//        rather than `true`: `on` names the moment the Engine notices ("aimed" before something
//        lands on its holder, "harmed" after something has hurt them), `at` says whom what is taken
//        is pointed at, and `cancels` stops what the window was holding from happening at all. An
//        entry that still says only `true` is on no menu, exactly as before, so a package that
//        ships one needs nothing newer. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.32:
//        an Engine that cannot read the object refuses the whole catalog asset, so a package that
//        ships one declares 1.33. No permission.
// 1.34: a bestiary creature described in the ruleset's own terms. A creature may carry a `sheet`:
//        a character sheet, as partial as it likes, keyed by the ids the ruleset declares. An
//        opponent built from one is built the way a party member is, so its health (a pool or a
//        track), defense, saves, speed, initiative and the abilities on its lists come from the
//        ruleset's own declarations, and it may pay for them out of its own pools. The fixed
//        `health`, `defense` and `initiativeModifier` a creature needed before are then not given,
//        and a creature with a sheet may have no block actions of its own. Not a soft seam, for the
//        same reason as 1.20 through 1.33: an Engine that cannot read the key refuses the whole
//        strict catalog file, so a package that ships one declares 1.34. No permission.
// 1.36: package achievements. `api.registerAchievements` adds badges to the Home panel and
//        `api.runtime.achievements` reads and unlocks them. Requires the `achievements` permission.
// 1.37: a check's rules moved for one roll, and a sheet the Game Master reads more of.
//        `resolution.explode` and `resolution.double` may carry a `min` (and then may leave `from`
//        out) so a check can move the face they fire on, a catalog entry's `mechanics.check` may do
//        the same with `explode` and `double`, `resolution.pool.abilityPlusAbility` lets an ability
//        check add a second ability, and `resolution.botch.rule` reads a botch as low faces on half
//        the dice or more. On the sheet, a plain `live.tracks` entry may take its `max` from a value
//        the sheet works out and may carry `hideWhen` and `alwaysShow`, and a `gm.sheetSummary.lists`
//        entry may show `columns` and be named by an enum column. Not a soft seam, for the same
//        reason as 1.20 through 1.34: an Engine that cannot read these keys refuses the whole
//        ruleset file, or the catalog file that holds them, so a package that ships any of them
//        declares 1.37. No permission.
// 1.38: what a check may buy and what rides along on it. `resolution.reroll` lists standing re-throws
//        a check may name with `reroll=`, a `resolution.spend` entry may buy a `reroll` and read its
//        `perCheck` limit off the sheet (a value reference, or `"pool"` for the check's own dice), a
//        ruleset may declare up to four spends, and `resolution.adjust` adds numbers off the sheet to
//        every check they apply to. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.37: an
//        Engine that cannot read these keys refuses the whole ruleset file, so a package that ships
//        any of them declares 1.38. No permission.
// 1.39: what a sheet can read. A value reference may read a live track (`liveTrack`, with `read`)
//        or pool (`livePool`), or add up a list's column (`listSum`); a skill or save may carry a
//        `cap`; and `hideWhen` may compare with `notEquals` or `in` as well as `equals`. Not a soft
//        seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.38: an Engine that cannot read these keys
//        refuses the whole ruleset file, so a package that ships any of them declares 1.39. No
//        permission.
// 1.40: wound tracks that are more than a fixed list. A track may be numbered `boxes` (as many as
//        its own `max`, with a penalty table over boxes filled or remaining), `fill` by box
//        (`indexed`), `onFull: "refuse"`, and take `extra` levels from a list; a rest's restore
//        step may name the `kind` it heals. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through
//        1.39: an Engine that cannot read these keys refuses the whole ruleset file, so a package
//        that ships any of them declares 1.40. No permission.
// 1.41: abilities, skills and saves may sit in a `section`, and a skill, save or section may say
//        what a check does `untrained` (roll as usual, one step harder, not at all, or `by` a
//        number). Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.40: an Engine that cannot
//        read these keys refuses the whole ruleset file, so a package that ships any of them
//        declares 1.41. No permission.
// 1.42: a sheet's live section may declare `states` (one value out of a closed set that changes in
//        play, set by `op="state"`), a derived value may be an `enumTable` keyed on an enum field or a
//        live state, and a rest's restore step may put a `state` back. Not a soft seam, for the same
//        reason as 1.20 through 1.41: an Engine that cannot read these keys refuses the whole ruleset
//        file, so a package that ships any of them declares 1.42. No permission.
// 1.43: a ruleset's combat block may declare `checks` (numbers off the sheet a contest reads) and
//        `contests` (both sides throw the attack dice and add a check; winning applies or ends
//        conditions and pushes on a board), and a creature may give its own `checks`. Not a soft
//        seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.42: an Engine that cannot read these keys
//        refuses the whole ruleset or catalog file, so a package that ships any of them declares
//        1.43. No permission.
// 1.44: a catalog entry's reaction may wait for `on: "used"` (somebody on the other side is about to
//        use something, anywhere it reaches, and it may be called off) and may name `against` (only
//        entries of these catalogs open its moment). Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20
//        through 1.43: an Engine that cannot read these refuses the whole catalog, so a package that
//        ships any of them declares 1.44. No permission.
// 1.45: a combat condition may change numbers (`modifiers` to defense, attacks, saves, checks and
//        speed) and make checks easier or harder, `combat.levels` makes a live track's levels count
//        as conditions, and an applied condition may count down as turns begin (`duration.at`) or end
//        after one use (`endsAfter`). Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.44: an
//        Engine that cannot read these refuses the whole ruleset or catalog file, so a package that
//        ships any of them declares 1.45. No permission.
// 1.46: a reaction may wait for `on: "hit"` (an attack roll has just hit its holder, before the
//        damage; what is taken counts for that attack), and a creature's action may carry the same
//        `reaction` object and `self: true` for one that lands on the creature itself. Not a soft
//        seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.45: an Engine that cannot read these refuses the
//        whole catalog, so a package that ships any of them declares 1.46. No permission.
// 1.47: a second combat kind, `dice-pool`: a fight thrown in the ruleset's own pools and counted in
//        successes, with a `pool` block (damage target and soak by kind), a creature's own `soak`,
//        and an attack row's `toHit.skill`. Beside it, for either kind, `initiative.each` throws
//        initiative again every round and `combat.spendLimits` caps what one combatant spends of a
//        pool per turn or round. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.46: an Engine
//        that cannot read these refuses the whole ruleset or catalog file, so a package that ships
//        any of them declares 1.47. No permission.
// 1.48: initiative in a `dice-pool` fight may be thrown as a pool (`initiative.pool`, whose
//        successes and `plus` are the number), and may be a number attacks move
//        (`initiative.resource`: styles of attack that take it or spend it, a crash line, and the
//        order following it every round). Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.47:
//        an Engine that cannot read these refuses the whole ruleset file, so a package that ships any
//        of them declares 1.48. No permission.
// 1.49: a ruleset may describe items: an `items` block (categories, rarities, tags, stats, slots,
//        binding, carry, currencies, `native` and `freeform`) and a third catalog kind,
//        `holds: "items"`, whose entries carry an `item`. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20
//        through 1.48: an Engine that cannot read these refuses the whole ruleset or catalog file, so
//        a package that ships any of them declares 1.49. No permission.
// 1.50: Professor Mari actions. A package holding the `mari-actions` permission may register
//        `api.registerService("mari-actions:<package-id>", { list, run })`, and Professor Mari's
//        `package_service` tool can list and run those actions. Requires the `mari-actions` permission.
// 1.51: items the Game Master invents. A ruleset's `items` block may carry `rarityCaps` (the largest
//        value of each number stat an invented item of a rarity may give) and `propose` (false forbids
//        invention). Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.49: an Engine that cannot
//        read these refuses the whole ruleset file, so a package that ships either declares 1.51. No
//        permission.
// 1.52: a value may read the items someone holds (`itemStat`: a stat over their worn, carried or
//        all items, by sum, highest, lowest or count, optionally only one slot, category or tag).
//        Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.51: an Engine that cannot read it
//        refuses the whole ruleset or catalog file, so a package that ships one declares 1.52. No
//        permission.
// 1.53: conditions and items change checks outside a fight. An item may say what it does while
//        `worn` and while only `carried` (advantage or disadvantage, modifiers to checks and saves,
//        saves it fails), a condition or a level may narrow its check effects to some `skills`, a
//        modifier may name its own `skills` or `saves` and roll twice (`mode`), and a rarity cap may
//        hold a worn or carried `bonus`. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.52: an
//        Engine that cannot read these refuses the whole ruleset or catalog file, so a package that
//        ships any of them declares 1.53. No permission.
// 1.54: an item may ask something of whoever wears it (`requires`: a value off their sheet, the least
//        it may be, and what applies while they fall short), a worn or carried effect may set or raise
//        an ability (`abilities`), and a condition level may read a derived value (`derived`) instead
//        of a live track. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.53: an Engine that
//        cannot read these refuses the whole ruleset or catalog file, so a package that ships any of
//        them declares 1.54. No permission.
// 1.55: an item may be a weapon (`attack`: what it adds to hit, deals, reaches and carries, each value
//        written down or read off the item's own stat), offered in a ruleset fight while it is worn,
//        and a creature's resistance or immunity may name the item tags a blow gets through it with
//        (`{ type, except }`). Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.54: an Engine
//        that cannot read these refuses the whole ruleset or catalog file, so a package that ships
//        any of them declares 1.55. No permission.
// 1.56: what an item does while worn or carried may change a fight (modifiers to defense, attacks and
//        speed, the fight's condition effects, and the kinds of harm and conditions it keeps off:
//        `resist`, `vulnerable`, `immune`, `conditionImmunities`), `combat.pool.hardness` reads a
//        fighter's hardness, and a creature may have `hardness`. Not a soft seam, for the same reason
//        as 1.20 through 1.55: an Engine that cannot read these refuses the whole ruleset or catalog
//        file, so a package that ships any of them declares 1.56. No permission.
// 1.57: a weapon's attack may shoot something (`ammo`: a carried item's tag, how many an attack, the
//        share picked up after a won fight) and keep a loaded count (`clip`: how many it holds and
//        the budget a reload spends), and a ruleset fight writes what it shot and loaded to the
//        inventory. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.56: an Engine that cannot
//        read these refuses the whole ruleset or catalog file, so a package that ships any of them
//        declares 1.57. No permission.
// 1.58: a weapon's attack may have other `modes` of making it, be an `offHand` weapon (with the
//        combat block's `offHand` budget), deal at least a `floor` on a hit, and put conditions on a
//        target `onHit`. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.57: an Engine that
//        cannot read these refuses the whole ruleset or catalog file, so a package that ships any of
//        them declares 1.58. No permission.
// 1.59: an item may be `use`d in a fight (a heal, an attack, a buff or a debuff, on a budget or
//        free, that is used up or spends the item's `charges`), and a ruleset fight writes what it
//        used up and the charges left to the inventory. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20
//        through 1.58: an Engine that cannot read these refuses the whole ruleset or catalog file, so
//        a package that ships any of them declares 1.59. No permission.
// 1.60: an item's `use` may `restore` a pool, and an item is used outside a fight too (the Use
//        button and the Game Master's `[inventory: action="use"]`). Not a soft seam, for the same
//        reason as 1.20 through 1.59: an Engine that cannot read `restore` refuses the whole ruleset
//        or catalog file, so a package that ships it declares 1.60. No permission.
// 1.61: an item's `charges` may `recharge` on the ruleset's rests (all of them, or an amount) and may
//        break when a use spends the last one (`breaksOn`), and a rest writes the charges it brings
//        back to the inventory. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.60: an Engine
//        that cannot read these refuses the whole ruleset or catalog file, so a package that ships
//        either declares 1.61. No permission.
// 1.62: an item's `use` may have a `gate`, a check its user passes before it works unless a value
//        on their sheet is high enough; a failed check uses the item up for nothing. Not a soft seam,
//        for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.61: an Engine that cannot read `gate` refuses the whole
//        ruleset or catalog file, so a package that ships it declares 1.62. No permission.
// 1.63: the items block may declare `lootTables`, and a bestiary creature may name the `loot` table a
//        won fight rolls for it; a ruleset with loot tables drops its own items instead of Game Mode's
//        native loot. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through 1.62: an Engine that cannot
//        read these refuses the whole ruleset or catalog file, so a package that ships either declares
//        1.63. No permission.
// 1.64: a layer may take coins out of the ruleset's currencies (`currencies.removeUnits` and
//        `removeFamilies`), and a loot line may drop coins (`coins`); coins are held as inventory stacks
//        (`coin:<unit>`) that the Game Master pays and earns with. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as
//        1.20 through 1.63: an Engine that cannot read these refuses the whole ruleset file, so a package
//        that ships either declares 1.64. No permission.
// 1.65: the items block may declare a `market` (price levels, place sizes, what each place sells, and
//        kinds of seller), and an item may name the smallest place that sells it (`sold`) or be a
//        `service`, bought and never carried; the Game Master buys with `[inventory: action="buy"]` and
//        says where the party is with `[place:]`. Not a soft seam, for the same reason as 1.20 through
//        1.64: an Engine that cannot read these refuses the whole ruleset or catalog file, so a package
//        that ships any of them declares 1.65. No permission.
// 1.66: `api.registerSceneOrigin` lets a package thread (a direct-message thread, for example) be the
//        origin of a roleplay scene, the way a Conversation is: the package supplies the planning
//        context, holds the lock while the scene runs and receives the recap when it ends. The browser
//        view gets `startScene`, `openChat`, `focusSceneOriginId` and `onFocusSceneOriginHandled`. Requires
//        the `scenes` permission.
