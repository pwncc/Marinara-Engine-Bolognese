Summarize only durable roleplay/session continuity from the supplied new message range for Marinara Engine LTM import. Optimize for typed-memory extraction, not reader recap.

## Core rules

- Cover only the supplied message range. Do not repeat content already present in supplied previous summaries.
- Extract only explicit, future-useful continuity. Do not invent, infer, intensify, or resolve ambiguity.
- Attribute uncertain claims literally, such as \`Alice suspects Rowan lied.\`
- Use one bullet per discrete memory.
- Collapse action chains into durable outcomes.
- Use past tense for what happened within the source range. Use present tense only for facts, traits, relationships, rules, and statuses that remain true at the end of the range.
- Preserve exact quotes only when useful for durable voice, promises, or recurring callbacks.
- Omit transient state unless it caused a durable consequence or plot pivot. Include consequential fights, injuries with lasting effects, meaningful gains or losses, debts, and conflicts as events; record any lasting result in the appropriate stream.
- Do not duplicate content across streams. \`timeline_event\` owns event prose; other streams contain only distinct durable consequences.
- Preserve character names exactly in fields that identify participants.
- Use consistent lowercase_snake_case IDs derived from source names. These are local labels; the importer resolves identity.
- For relationships, alphabetize the two local subject IDs; list \`characters\` in the same order. Always preserve source names exactly.
- Reuse event IDs exactly in links. Include \`caused_by\`, \`evidenced_by\`, \`planted_in\`, \`paid_off_in\`, or \`resolved_in\` only when the linked event appears in this summary or supplied previous summaries.
- Include only headings containing content.
- If nothing durable changed, set the JSON \`summary\` value exactly to: \`No durable memory updates.\`

## Metadata

### KEY
\`message_range: first_id-last_id or unknown | aliases: explicitly supplied or source-established aliases, or none | previous_summary_boundary: supplied boundary or unknown\`
Do not infer missing message ranges, aliases, or summary boundaries.

### coverage_audit
List only continuity-relevant named characters:
- \`Name | captured\`
- \`Name | audit_only: reason\`
This section is metadata, not memory content.

## Memory streams

### timeline_event
Specific plot pivots, decisions, discoveries, outcomes, promises, arrivals, departures, relationship-causing moments, and thread planting or payoff events.
- \`[IMPORTANCE] event_id: specific_event_id | section: event | text: explicit outcome | quotes: "exact quote" if useful\`

### character_fact
Only durable identity, role, affiliation, trait, belief, ability, possession, progression, backstory state, or lasting status.
Describe the durable state, not the event that established it. Put establishing events in \`timeline_event\` and link changed states with \`caused_by\`.
Sections: \`facts\`, \`developments\`, \`abilities\`, \`items\`, \`voice\`, \`progression\`.
- \`[IMPORTANCE] subject: character_id | section: section_name | text: durable fact or explicit transition | caused_by: event_id if changed\`
Do not include ordinary actions, decisions, discoveries, arrivals, promises, combat beats, relationship moments, or temporary states. Items and progression must contain only the latest explicit value.

### relationship_state
A durable state or meaningful change between exactly two named characters.
Supported dimensions: \`trust\`, \`respect\`, \`loyalty\`, \`intimacy\`, \`tension\`, \`hostility\`, \`dependency\`, \`affection\`, \`lust\`, \`protectiveness\`.
- \`[IMPORTANCE] subject: character_id_one_character_id_two | characters: Name One, Name Two | section: state | text: literal observed state | dimensions: exact source values only | changes: explicit changes only | caused_by: event_id for a change\`
Never estimate numeric dimensions from prose. Do not promote routine warmth, jokes, or minor kindnesses into relationship changes.

### world_fact
Stable lore, rules, geography, factions, institutions, history, or non-character-specific items. Sections: \`facts\`, \`items\`.
- \`[IMPORTANCE] subject: world_subject_id | section: facts/items | text: stable fact | evidenced_by: event_id if applicable\`

### thread
An explicit unresolved goal, question, tension, quest, or unpaid callback.
Include a thread when the source explicitly establishes an unresolved matter or resolves a thread found in supplied previous summaries. State a resolver only when the source provides one; otherwise omit the resolver field. Do not invent possible outcomes or resolution conditions.
Sections: \`summary\`, \`objective\`, \`stage\`, \`resolution\`.
- \`[IMPORTANCE] subject: thread_id | section: section_name | status: active/resolved | text: explicit open loop or resolution | resolver: explicit source-backed condition if stated | resolved_in: event_id if resolved\`
Prefix unpaid callback text with \`[CALLBACK]\`.

### anchor
A recurring symbol, motif, continuity marker, inside joke, or established callback. Do not use anchors for merely unresolved situations.
- \`[IMPORTANCE] subject: anchor_id | section: motif/callback/anchor | text: recurring element | planted_in: event_id if known | paid_off_in: event_id if known\`

### tone
Only a durable session or world presentation style. Exclude one-scene mood and individual character voice.
- \`[IMPORTANCE] subject: session | section: observations | text: durable register\`

## Importance
Use \`[CRITICAL]\`, \`[MAJOR]\`, \`[MODERATE]\`, or \`[MINOR]\` according to future continuity value.

## Output
Return only valid JSON using the summary endpoint contract:
{
  "name": "short one-line title for this summary",
  "summary": "the concise LTM report using the exact headings and field labels above"
}
Put the complete report inside the \`summary\` string. Omit optional fields when unsupported. Be concise but complete.`;

Use the scenario, character cards, persona, chat summary, and recent messages. If Secret Plot State exists, evaluate whether the previous arc has been resolved by the actual story so far.
If there is no previous arc, create one.
If the previous arc is still active, preserve its core mystery and update details only when the story has materially changed.
If the previous arc has now been completed, return that arc with completed=true. A follow-up maintenance pass will then create the next arc from the completed state.
If Secret Plot State already contains completed=true, create a new arc that builds on what came before and set completed=false.
Do not write scene prose, dialogue, narration, or instructions for exact character actions. Do not decide for the user.
Return only valid JSON:

  "overarchingArc": {
    "description": "string - 2-4 sentences describing the arc, its mystery, resolution conditions, and protagonist journey",
